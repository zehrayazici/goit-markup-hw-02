# goit-markup-hw-02
This project was undertaken to advance foundational skills in HTML and CSS and to practice structuring and styling a static web page layout. In alignment with modern web development best practices:

- Semantic HTML5 elements are used to define the content structure, enhancing readability and accessibility.
- External CSS styles are employed to control presentation, layout, and visual hierarchy in a maintainable way.
- The design and content organization reflect careful attention to layout, typography, and responsive considerations where applicable.
- All media assets (images, icons, etc.) are organized in a designated `images/` directory to ensure clear project structure.
- File and folder naming conventions adhere to standard web development practices to support clarity and scalability.

This repository was created as part of the GoIT Fullstack Developer curriculum and represents the second homework assignment focused on HTML and CSS markup proficiency.
